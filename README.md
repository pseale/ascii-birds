Daily Programmer #157
=====================

Note: this repository is 100% empty right now, I'm not sure why I wrote anything in the README as I've implemented absolutely nothing. If you're reading this, assume the project is unfinished.

This is an in-the-browser implementation of "ASCII birds", a simplified, turn-based flappy birds clone. It is implemented in JavaScript.

For my own convenience, I have included thin. 

Full details of the problem (and similar solutions) can be found at http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/22slvn/4112014_challenge_157_hard_ascii_bird/

I have borrowed (MIT-licensed) code from http://nkwiatek.com/experiments/ascii to help me implement the "ASCII experience" in the browser.

Goals
-----

* Get into the swing of things
* Solve a fun problem
* Try out jasmine unit tests
* ? Try out capybara tests ? TBD

Things I could and probably should improve, but won't
-----------------------------------------------------

TBD, I haven't implemented anything yet.
